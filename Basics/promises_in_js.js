/* 
    What is a promise?
    
    In simple example,
    with our daily-life, that, we orderd food from Zomato and Swiggy, and they promised us to deliver the food within few minutes.
    Then we do our task.

    So, in JavaScript, 
    Promise is a promise of code excution, that, it will be executed in future.
    The code either executed successfully or failed. 
    In both the cases, the user will be notified.

    Syntax:
    let Promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        // executor (the producing code)
    })
